# Handrolled: a minimalist framework

This project is a very minimalist framework for quickly getting an easily consumable API up and running in a few minutes.
It uses very few dependencies and the ones that have been pulled in are small and make the whole experience dope as hell.

## Background

I'll be upfront: this project exists because I got the munchies to learn how modern PHP frameworks did magical stuff like routing, dependency injection, object-relational mappers, load configuration, etc. All that magical stuff is even more cool when you pull back the curtain and dig into some code and try to implement it for yourself. Several patterns here are heavily inspired by the Laravel framework, because that's my technical background as a programmer that uses Laravel every day.

Do yourself a favor and don't use this in a production level, enterprise app. It'll probably change a good deal.

# Installation

The easiest way to get started quickly would be to clone the `PikaJew002/handrolled-project` repository and follow the few steps in the README (make empty directory, clone repo to directory, composer install), then head over to the [docs](https://pikajew002.github.io/handrolled/) to learn more in-depth.

Alternatively, install like so.

You can install the Handrolled framework as a Composer package like so:

```sh
composer require pikajew002/handrolled
```

Install the dependencies:

```sh
composer install
```

If you want more info on the dependencies that were used, check out the `composer.json` file. There are a few.
